### MPS Instance 
We strongly reccomend to have one and the only one MPS instance per MPS endpoint and retain it for the further usage.

```swift
var mps: MPS?

func start() {
    mps = MPS(url: url, site: site, options: options)
}
```


### MPS Page

We strongly reccomend to have save MPSPage instance in while the correlated view are alive. It can improve SDK performance.

```swift
var page: MPSPage?
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    let params = MPSPageParameters(path: "page")
    page = mps.requestPageObject(mpsParams: params)
}
```
